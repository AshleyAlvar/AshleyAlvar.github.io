### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
One of my favorite labs was lab 1 because it was the first thing I coded in this class. I love the practice of making your first code be Hello World. It also helps builds your confidence in coding.

* Lab 3
Lab 3, part 2 is a favorite of mine which is about Julian days. It helped me understand how functions worked. It was the first lab where I had to call functions. I also enjoyed how it output the amount of days between two dates.

* Lab 7
I really enjoyed making the functions and the if statements in part-2. It was about making a program that showed me what times I could park at certain streets. It was a challenge at first, but I was able to perservere.
